Here, you find answer to the most recurrent questions in the !CloudSim mailing list.


== 1. Is !CloudSim the right tool for my project?  ==

!CloudSim is a simulator, so it doesn't run any actual software technology. Simulation can be defined as "running a model of a software in a model of hardware". As it's all about models, specific technology details are abstracted. More information about differences between simulation, emulation, and other experiments methodologies can be found in:

Gustedt, J.; Jeannot, E. and Quinson, M. Experimental methodologies for large-scale systems: a survey, Parallel Processing Letters, World Scientific, 2009, 19(3), 399-418.

Therefore, if the goal of your project is running an actual software that you developed, or plan to develop (a package, an algorithm) in an actual system perhaps you'd rather develop your software and test it in a small-scale data center, containing a few hosts running [http://www.eucalyptus.com/ Eucalyptus].
