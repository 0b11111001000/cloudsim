Here, you find answer to the most recurrent questions in the CloudSim mailing list.


== Is the CloudSim the right tool for my project?  ==

CloudSim is a simulator, so it doesn't run any actual software technology. Simulation can be defined as "running a model of a software in a model of hardware". As it's all about models, specific technology details are abstracted. More information about differences between simulation, emulation, and other experiments methodologies can
be found in [1].

If the goal of your project is running actual software in an actual system perhaps you'd rather develop your software and test it in a small-scale data center, containing a few hosts running [http://www.eucalyptus.com/ Eucalyptus].
